# Wordle Solver

A basic algorithm that attempts to solve Wordle.
The program outputs guesses and you then respond with the colours for the letters. For example, if the word "arose" has colours yellow, grey (black), grey, grey, green, then enter "ybbbg". A new guess will be generated using this information.
If the word is not found in the wordle dictionary, enter an empty line.
